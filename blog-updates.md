### Project Inception - December 2024
What? work on a Go-based implementation of the classic Eye of the Beholder engine. Initial focus on PAK file parsing and LCW compression algorithms.

The goal is to create a modern, maintainable codebase while preserving the authentic gameplay experience.

### Asset Pipeline Progress - January 2025
Successfully implemented PAK file extraction and LCW decompression! 

Next steps:
- Palette handling for VGA colors
- Sprite rendering pipeline
- Basic UI framework

### Latest Breakthrough - January 15, 2025
